v2 of USBpatch is designed to provide the core hardware functionality for the Lenovo Ideacentre q150. Instead of the Acer Aspire Revo which is no longer on the market.

Key differences: the q150 has no speaker thus no beep.
The q150 also has a newer ethernet card that requires Ubunty 10. So this will be based on TurnkeyLinux's Lucid.
